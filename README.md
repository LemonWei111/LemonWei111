- 👋 Hi, I’m @LemonWei111
- You can call me Lemon, or 靖 in Chinese(Note that the left side of the character is '立', not '女', as many people make mistakes when writing it but I disapprove of such errors).

- 👀 I’m interested in areas of Artificial Intelligence, especially in Computer Vision.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Nature Language Process(including Large Language Model) and Speech Technology.
- I'm preparing to do a project related to medical diagnosis and treatment in my undergraduate graduation project, which may be highly related to CV and sensors, while NLP and Speech can be used for interaction.

- 📫 Reach me through weixin: AJ031817
- 😄 Pronouns: Sichuan, China
- ⚡ Fun fact: Acting, Writing, Jumping!
